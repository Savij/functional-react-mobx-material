This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to show how to use mobx, material-ui and react-router within typescript and functional components.

### This is an example project featuring:

- React 16.x (from create-react-app)
  - Typescript
  - functional components
- Material-UI
  - Custom Theme
- Mobx-React
  - via context providers
- Google Fonts
- ESLint

### Hope this helps others as I think this is a good implementation of the items I wanted to use. If you see something that I could have done better, please let me know. Most of this was put together from things I found elsewhere online.

#### Install:

- clone
- npm install (or yarn add)
- npm start
